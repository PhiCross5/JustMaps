# JustMaps
Just a map viewer for unix-like systems. 

## Status
Very early work-in-progress, only very basic parsing via the `OsmParser.lua` script is available right now.

## Requirements
Average user (view maps, browse data):

- lua 5.1 or other compatible interpreter/compiler/JIT
- GTK libraries 
- A working graphical environment (e.g. GNOME, KDE Plasma, i3, sway or even a barebones X11 launcher should work fine)
- luarocks packages: `posix, inotify, lgi`
- 
Minimalists, programmers, i3 ricers and the like:

- lua 5.1 or compatible runtime.


## REFERENCE PLATFORM
Expect to be able to run the map viewer if your computer is in line or better than this:
- dual-core 2.0GHz core 2 duo from 2009
- screen (optional)
- 100MB of RAM available
- keyboard and mouse (optional)
